### Project Objectives
  
The objective of this project is to understand whether the variables we have found have an impact on criminality and if they do, how they affect it (negatively or positively and significantly or not). 

We will focus on education, mental health expenditure by the governments, GDP and composition of the population.

Our aim is to identify potential policy targets in dealing with criminality and, consequently, quality of life in a Country/State. 

### Project's Outline

The project has been organized in different phases, all carried through the software R. 
In this section we will explain how we organized our work for you to have a clear idea of our project. 

We start by searching relevant data-sets on the internet and looking for variables of interest. Then, we proceed by cleaning and tidying each of them. This process is done by trying to have each data-set in the same form, to ease a later analysis of them. 
We create the whole final data-set with all the wanted information from the different sources. 

Then, we begin the Explanatory Data Analysis exploiting visualization tools and summarizing main characteristics of the data-set.
