When thinking at welfare and government expenditure in health, we often focus on physical health and not much in mental health. Starting this project out main idea was to study the relationship between Mental Health Services and Homicides. Later, we moved to a broader view to study which are the factor that mostly impact criminality in a developed country. 

After looking up for relevant data-sets on the internet, we decided to concentrate on United States of America, looking for data for each state.

The main motivation behind our project is our interest in social sciences and policies. Indeed, before starting, we decided for this topic because, possibly, our results will be interesting for a policy maker in taking decisions on education and mental health services expenditure and provision, as well as other factors.
