The project has been organized in different phases, all carried through the software R. 
In this section we will explain how we organized our work for you to have a clear idea of our project. 

We start by searching relevant data-sets on the internet and looking for variables of interest. Then, we proceed by cleaning and tidying each of them. This process is done by trying to have each data-set in the same form, to ease a later analysis of them. 
We create the whole final data-set with all the wanted information from the different sources. 

Then, we begin the Explanatory Data Analysis exploiting visualization tools and summarizing main characteristics of the data-set.
