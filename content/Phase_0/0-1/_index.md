### Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to understand whether the variables we have found have an impact on criminality and if they do, how they affect it (negatively or positively and significantly or not). 

We will focus on education, mental health expenditure by the governments, GDP and composition of the population.

Our aim is to identify potential policy targets in dealing with criminality and, consequently, quality of life in a Country/State.
