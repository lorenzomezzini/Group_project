The research questions we will try answering throughout our project are:

<ul>
  <li>Is there any relationship between expenditure for mental health by the government and criminality?</li>
  <li>Is the level of education and wealth (through GDP) of a State relevant for its level of criminality?</li>
  <li>Is the composition of the population, in terms of both age and ethnicity, relevant for criminality in the area? </li>
  <li>Is mental health expenditure affected by how much the population is educated or by GDP of the country? </li>
</ul><br>

Given the questions posed above, the answers we will search for in our project could lead a reader to question himself on how to exploit these presences of correlation to reach a lower level of criminality. Though, the latter consideration makes sense only if we are able to find significant relationship between the different variables.
