We are two students from the University of Bologna, and we are currently enrolled in the master course in Economics (LMEC). We are in our Swiss European Mobility Program in Lausanne.

This is the website for our project's report for the 2020 fall semester's class in "Data Science in Business Analytics" at the Universit√© de Lausanne.

This is our video presenting the project, 
Enjoy ;)
