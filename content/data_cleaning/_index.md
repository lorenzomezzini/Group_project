In this part we present the data we use to analyse and answer our research questions.
We start by importing and cleaning them. 
We use a total of 17 files to form our final data-set, we present them below separately, following the themes. 
Notice that we clean each data-set such that they all appear "standardized" (for example we select years from 2004 to 2013, since only in this time-framework we have all data available). This is done to facilitate the join process among all data-set.
