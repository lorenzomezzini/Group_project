In this section we are going to do an explanatory data analysis by using the cleaned data described 
in the data part. Throughout the section, we will still need some transformation of the data to
facilitate the visualization and to understand everything in a deeper way.

To present the crimes and the race in a nicer way, we decide to mutate the former in term of "per 1000 inhabitants" and the latter in percentage terms. This makes sense also because different countries have different dimensions and population size. Therefore, maintaining absolute magnitudes would probably give us a wrong perception and result. We don't change the variables' names, though.
